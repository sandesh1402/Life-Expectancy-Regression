Overview
This project involves predicting the life expectancy of various countries using machine learning techniques. The data used for this project includes socio-economic and health-related factors such as GDP, schooling, adult mortality, and alcohol consumption.

Key Steps
Data Collection: Sourced from WHO and other UN agencies, the dataset includes multiple features affecting life expectancy.
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, performed feature selection, and normalized the data.
Modeling: Implemented several regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²).
Results
The Random Forest Regressor provided the best predictions with a high R² score and low MAE, indicating accurate life expectancy estimates.
